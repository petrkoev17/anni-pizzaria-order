# Deadline - 23/12/2022 18.00 CEST
* The rubric will be applied to the code submitted tomorrow. Features added afterwards will not impact the grade for assignment 1. 
* Take a good look at the rubric to see whether we have done everything. Things that we still have to take a look at are: sprint retrospectives and other types of testing, such as functional and additional testing.
* For submitting the product, we should have everything on main and tag it correctly.
